# 👋 Hi, I’m Pranav Soni
  
A passionate final-year BTech CSE student 💻 with a strong focus on full-stack web development, particularly in frontend technologies like React.js ⚛️ and UI/UX design 🎨. My journey in tech has been shaped by numerous personal projects 🛠️, including crafting dynamic, responsive websites 🌐 and innovative applications 📱. I've developed a portfolio website, built an interactive Snake Game 🎮, and worked on a Java-based Email Administration tool ✉️, all while honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java 🧑‍💻.

🏆 I'm a national-level softball player with two gold medals 🥇🥇, and my drive for excellence extends beyond sports into my professional life. I take pride in my ability to lead teams 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, manage events 🎤, and communicate effectively 🗣️. Alongside my technical expertise, I value collaboration, continuous learning 📚, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible 🚀.

Whether it's working with the MERN stack 🌱, developing a task manager app 📋, or designing QuickDocMeet—an online appointment booking platform for doctors 🏥—I thrive on tackling complex challenges. Let's connect and build something great together! 🤝
